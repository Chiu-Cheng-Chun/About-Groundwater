# About-Groundwater
These studies are done through Machine Learning technology.

This is my research with my partner. The content of the study is about the addendum of groundwater level data, the prediction of groundwater level prediction and the prediction of pumping volume. However, due to the confidentiality of the information, we do not disclose the datasets we use in the program, but you can refer to my information found in the Python Crawler.
